repository cherenkov effect 

this contains 2 files
animation.py doing all the plotting
cherenkov_simulation.py containing the user interface

this only works if the velocity of the ball is higher than speed of light, I. e. when cherenkov occurs
intensity damping is a little arbitrary and I feel some major updates are needed. 

For instance one may implement the photon number equation which introduces the frequency dependence
